# Measure Reinforcement: Emergent Causality From Quantum Interactions
**Author**: Mohammad Mahdi Mirrashid  
**Abstract**: Measure Reinforcement (MR) is a relational quantum framework for emergent causality. MR's updates mirror STDP, suggesting a quantum basis for neural learning. Includes convergence proofs and Petz recovery analysis.  
**Status**: Under review on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15214996).
